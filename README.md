# Pebble Music Library

An app for the Pebble smartwatch that lets you browse your phone's music library and start playing songs without pulling your phone out of your pocket.

**Work in progress!** The phone companion app is only available for Android and has no UI yet. Playlists are not implemented.

If you're developing a music player for Android, see [PROTOCOL_ANDROID_INTENTS.md](https://github.com/myfreeweb/pebble-music-library/blob/master/PROTOCOL_ANDROID_INTENTS.md).
